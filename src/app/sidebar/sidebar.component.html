<!--
 You will notice routerLink= here. Instead of href, we use routerLink to direct the user to different routes. Right now, this will not work though, we'll get to that during the routing section.
We're also going to use Material Icons, so we need to import that first. 
Save this file and open up /src/index.html and add the following 2 lines between the <head> tags:
  We're importing the Router and NavigationEnd, then defining a string 
  property currentUrl. Then, we create an instance of the Router in order 
  to subscribe to router.events. It will provide us with a string, which is 
  the current router path.

<nav>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a routerLink="" [class.activated]="currentUrl == '/'">
        <i class="material-icons">supervised_user_circle</i>
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a routerLink="posts" [class.activated]="currentUrl == '/posts'">
        <i class="material-icons">message</i>
      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>
</nav>
